# Module 2 - Portfolio Site Challenge

## Description

This is a challenge for the end of the second week of the Trilogy Front End Web Development Bootcamp. 

For this challenge, a responsive mobile-first website had to be created, using html and CSS. A layout was given and the result had to be similar with some customization allowed in terms of images, content and colours. 

For this website CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid were used, along with other CSS style rules, along with CSS Variables (CSS Custom properties).
